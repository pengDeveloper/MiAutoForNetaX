# xAuto

**Xiaomi CarWith, OPPO Car+, vivo Jovi InCar and other ICCOA CarLink phones, on your car's head
unit. Wireless.**

**xAuto runs on the car**, advertises itself as an ICCOA CarLink-capable head unit, and pairs
with a phone that already supports it — Xiaomi CarWith, OPPO Car+ 车联, vivo Jovi InCar and
others. Your phone keeps its own maps, music and calling apps — nothing extra is installed on
the phone, and the car needs no companion account, dongle, cable, root or firmware modification.

> turn is an independent fork of [Open Headunit](https://github.com/andreknieriem/open-headunit).
> The car-side shell, the settings tree and the BYD cluster / HUD outputs come from that

> Xiaomi CarWith, OPPO Car+ and vivo Jovi InCar all speak.

## What's new in 0.1.1

Wording only — behaviour is identical to 0.1.0.

- ICCOA CarLink is a standard jointly initiated by Xiaomi, OPPO and vivo, so the home screen,
  the About and Support screens and the legal notice now name Xiaomi CarWith, OPPO Car+ and
  vivo Jovi InCar together instead of Xiaomi alone.
- The legal notice now explains what ICCOA CarLink is, and lists OPPO and vivo alongside
  Xiaomi, ICCOA, Google and BYD.
- Added Traditional Chinese home-screen strings; a zh-TW device used to fall back to English.

## What's new in 0.1.0

First public release.

- Wireless ICCOA CarLink reception on the car — Xiaomi CarWith, OPPO Car+ and vivo Jovi InCar
  phones included — with a 6-digit pairing code shown on the car screen and confirmed on the
  phone.
- A **30-second re-advertise watchdog**: while the car is unconnected it restarts its
  advertisement, which brings back a pairing prompt that was dismissed on the phone without
  restarting the app.
- The **full settings tree inherited from the base project** — connection, display, video,
  input, audio, backup, reset and diagnostics.
- The inherited **instrument cluster and HUD projection paths**, kept for cars that expose
  those areas and off by default.
- Its own package name (`com.xbutler.xauto`) and its own release signing key, so xAuto installs
  next to other receiver apps on the same head unit.

## Headline features

Each item below is described with its actual state, not just its promise.

### 1. Phone connectivity on the car

The app advertises an ICCOA CarLink head unit — the kind Xiaomi CarWith, OPPO Car+ and vivo
Jovi InCar all connect to; the phone finds it in the nearby-device list, a 6-digit code is
confirmed on the phone, and the phone screen appears on the car. There is no button to press
on the car side for a normal first pairing.

The car-side codebase still contains the Android Auto half of the base project. It is kept
only as a foreground keep-alive, and its Android-Auto-only side effects are deliberately
disabled through a build flag, because the ones that matter here would fight the CarWith
session for the Wi-Fi Direct group and the local hotspot it needs for its data channel.

### 2. A pairing prompt that comes back

The failure mode worth engineering against is a pairing prompt the user dismissed on the
phone. The car is still advertising, but the phone will not show the dialog again by itself,
and the previous behaviour was that the app had to be restarted.

xAuto re-advertises every 30 seconds while it is not connected:

| Mechanism | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Watchdog | `30 s` timer; on expiry, if still unconnected, re-advertise and schedule the next round |
| Re-advertise is stop-then-start | Repeating an unchanged advertisement is ignored, so the advertisement is restarted instead |
| Never interrupts a session | Skipped while a session is coming up or when a cast is running |
| Timer resets on a new code | The user gets the full 30 seconds to confirm |
| Manual entry point | A refresh button on the home screen retries immediately; visible only while unconnected |

### 3. Instrument cluster and HUD paths

The base project targets the instrument cluster area that BYD already exposes to third-party
apps, plus the windshield navigation outputs (arrows, distance, street names). Both paths are
carried over into xAuto for cars that expose them.

The cluster mirror is **experimental and off by default**. Where the cluster area is not shared
with apps, the setting reports the feature as unavailable rather than failing. Cluster
projection is opt-in per car; the mirror timing control below it is intentionally always shown,
because a control that hides itself is indistinguishable from a feature that was never built.

**These two paths are carried over and are not yet verified with xAuto's protocol stack.**

## Features

- Wireless reception for ICCOA CarLink phones (Xiaomi CarWith, OPPO Car+, vivo Jovi InCar and
  others); the phone stays in a pocket or on a wireless charger.
- Automatic pairing code, with the 30-second re-advertise watchdog described above.
- Full settings tree: connection, display, video, input, audio, backup, reset and diagnostics.
- Instrument cluster mirror and windshield HUD navigation, for cars that expose those areas.
- Car-friendly home screen: large pairing digits, a refresh button, one entry into settings.
- Own package name and signing key, so it coexists with other receiver apps.
- English and Simplified Chinese download page; the app itself ships the community
  translations inherited from the base project.

## Compatibility and setup

**Verified on a Newland NLS-MT9055-GL running Android 11 (arm64):** the app installs, starts,
advertises, shows a pairing code, completes a CarWith session, and the pairing code survives a
cold start.

**Not yet verified:** installation and pairing on a BYD or other production head unit, and the
instrument cluster / HUD projection paths. If you run one of those setups, expect to be an
early tester, and please report what you see.

A phone that supports ICCOA CarLink is required: Xiaomi CarWith, OPPO Car+ 车联, vivo Jovi
InCar, or an equivalent screen-mirroring entry in Settings. This is not Android Auto and not
Apple CarPlay.

See the [installation guide](docs/INSTALL.md), including permissions and installation routes.
APK installation must be allowed by your head unit. **Set up while parked.**

## Build

Requires JDK 17, Android SDK 36, NDK `29.0.14206865`, and CMake `3.22.1`.
Set `ANDROID_HOME` or an untracked `local.properties` with `sdk.dir=...`.

```sh
./gradlew :app:testGithubDebugUnitTest :app:assembleGithubDebug :app:assembleGithubRelease
```

APKs are under `app/build/outputs/apk/github/`.

### The CarWith / CarLink protocol layer is not in this repository

ICCOA CarLink — the protocol behind CarWith, Car+ and Jovi InCar — is consumed as a prebuilt
SDK that is **absent from git** (see [app/libs/README.md](app/libs/README.md)). The compile-time
half of it is a signature-only stub jar, `app/stubs/icar-sdk-stubs.jar`, which *is* committed —
it is used for type checking and never enters the APK.

Without the SDK dex the build still succeeds, but the resulting APK has no CarWith support.
When the SDK dex is present, `injectIccoaDex` appends it to the packaged APK as the next free
`classesN.dex`, then zipaligns and re-signs, because writing to the zip invalidates whatever
AGP signed. The task is a finalizer and therefore idempotent: it removes any previously
injected copy that is byte-identical to the SDK dex before appending, so repeated builds do not
inflate the APK.

### Signing

Release builds are signed when an untracked `key.properties` provides:

```properties
storeFile=/absolute/path/to/your-release-keystore.jks
storePassword=YOUR_PRIVATE_PASSWORD
keyAlias=YOUR_KEY_ALIAS
keyPassword=YOUR_PRIVATE_PASSWORD
```

`storeFile` may be relative to either the repository root or the `app/` module; both locations
are tried. Never commit signing keys or passwords. Your self-built APK will not upgrade a
public release unless it is signed with the same key.

### Application IDs

| Build | Application ID | Label |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Release | `com.xbutler.xauto` | xAuto |
| Debug (coexist) | `com.xbutler.xauto.debug` | xAuto |

The debug ID lets a test build sit next to a stable install on the same head unit.
Only the `github` flavor is covered by this repository's CI.

## Website

The static download page lives under `site/` and is generated by `scripts/build_site.py`.
Edit `site/content.json` and the `BASE` / `REPO` / `VERSION` constants near the top of that
script, then run:

```sh
python3 scripts/build_site.py
```

Do not hand-edit `site/*/index.html` — the next build overwrites them.
GitHub Actions deploys only `site/` to GitHub Pages.
